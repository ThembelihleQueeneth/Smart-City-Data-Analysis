## Task 1: The Five V's

### Question 1: Variety  
Different data types:  
- Numerical: `"value": 45.5`, `"value": 152`  
- String: `"value": "16.2C"`, `"value": "false"`  
- Null: `"value": null`  

### Question 2: Velocity  
Real-time processing enables city management.

### Question 3: Veracity  
Data quality checks are essential for trustworthy analytics:  
- `"value": -10` (negative AQI is invalid)  
- `"data_source_veracity": null` (unknown reliability for traffic data)

### Question 4: Volume  
Storage, Processing, and Cost

### Question 5: Value  
The sensors track how many cars are on the road.  
If too many cars are in one area, the system can suggest alternate routes to drivers (via GPS apps) to avoid traffic jams.  
Traffic lights adjust their timing based on real-time traffic flow.

This helps:
- Reduce waiting time at red lights
- Lower pollution (since cars aren’t idling as long)
- Decrease noise (less honking and engine revving)

## Task 2: Data Quality Assessment

### Question 1  
**Data quality** – The level of data accuracy and reliability to be used where appropriate.

### Question 2  
Issues identified:
- Date format inconsistency  
- Null values  
- Negative AQI (invalid data)

### Question 3

## Task 3: Data Governance & Security

### Question 1: Access Control  
Add "access_level" to the data

### Question 2: Breach Implications  
1. A data breach can have a devastating effect on an organization's reputation and financial bottom line.  
2. Compromised data can mean exposing highly confidential information to foreign parties.

### Question 3  
**Data Governance Office** – They are responsible for establishing data policies, access controls, and ensuring compliance with legal and ethical standards.
